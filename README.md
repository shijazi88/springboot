# springboot
I will try to write some examples about spring boot , please check Wiki tab for more details

We will explain the following annotations:

@Controller vs @RestController

Get, Post, Put, Delete examples

@RequestBody, @ResponseBody, @ResponseEntity

@PathVariable, @RequestParam

JSON vs XML

Manage the return JSON (remove fields, change the names of fields)

First example is explaining Rest services: In this example I will create GET, PUT, DELETE, POST http requests.
and I will use @Controller, @ ResponseBody, @PathVariable, @RequestBody
